# Data Safety - How Your Upload Works

## ✅ YOUR EXISTING DATA IS SAFE

When you upload your 217 leads to production, here's what happens:

## How It Works

```
BEFORE Upload:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Production Database        │
│  (Your live data)           │
│                             │
│  - 0 leads currently        │
│  - Users exist              │
│  - Settings saved           │
└─────────────────────────────┘

AFTER Upload:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Production Database        │
│  (Your live data)           │
│                             │
│  - 0 leads (if phone doesn't match)
│  - 217 NEW leads added      │
│  - Users still exist        │
│  - Settings still saved     │
│                             │
│  Total: 217 leads           │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Safety Features Built In

### 1. No Deletion
❌ **Never deletes** existing leads  
✅ **Only adds** new leads or updates matching ones

### 2. Phone Number Matching
```python
# Line 51-52 in import script:
existing_lead = Lead.objects.filter(phone=lead_data['phone']).first()

if existing_lead:
    # Lead with this phone already exists
    # UPDATE it with new data
    existing_lead.full_name = lead_data['full_name']
    # ... update other fields
else:
    # No lead with this phone
    # CREATE a new lead
    lead = Lead(...)
    lead.save()
```

### 3. What Happens to Duplicates?

Example scenario:
- Production has a lead with phone: "07973 428304" (Tyler's lead)
- Your upload has a lead with phone: "07973 428304" (same lead)

**Result**: The existing lead gets UPDATED with your data
**NOT**: Duplicate created

Example:
```
Production has: 50 leads
Your export has: 217 leads
Upload runs...

Result: 
- If all 217 are new → Production now has 267 leads
- If 10 are duplicates → Production now has 257 leads (50 + 217 - 10)
```

### 4. Skip Audit Trail
```python
# Line 103: lead.save(skip_audit=True)
```
This prevents creating duplicate audit logs during import.

## What Gets Uploaded

From `production_leads_export.json`:
```json
{
  "id": 3369,
  "lead_number": "MS001",
  "full_name": "Nadeem Mustafa",
  "phone": "07973 428304",
  "email": "",
  "status": "qualifier_callback",
  "address1": "14 Douglas Avenue",
  "postal_code": "NG4 1AJ",
  "notes": "...",
  "assigned_agent": "Tyler",
  "created_at": "2025-09-16T14:15:00+00:00"
}
```

All 217 of these will be added to production.

## Comparison Table

| What Happens | Will Upload Delete? | Will Upload Create? | Will Upload Update? |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Existing production leads | ❌ NO | ❌ NO | ✅ YES (if phone matches) |
| New leads (phone not in production) | ❌ NO | ✅ YES | ❌ NO |
| Production users | ❌ NO | ❌ NO | ❌ NO |
| Production settings | ❌ NO | ❌ NO | ❌ NO |
| Other data | ❌ NO | ❌ NO | ❌ NO |

## Real World Example

### Scenario: Production has 5 test leads

**Before Upload:**
```
Production Leads:
- Lead A: phone="111-111-1111"
- Lead B: phone="222-222-2222"  
- Lead C: phone="333-333-3333"
- Lead D: phone="444-444-4444"
- Lead E: phone="555-555-5555"
```

**After Upload:**
```
Production Leads:
- Lead A: phone="111-111-1111" (UPDATED - phone matches)
- Lead B: phone="222-222-2222" (UPDATED - phone matches)
- Lead C: phone="333-333-3333" (UPDATED - phone matches)
- Lead D: phone="444-444-4444" (UPDATED - phone matches)
- Lead E: phone="555-555-5555" (UPDATED - phone matches)
- Lead F: phone="666-666-6666" (NEW - no match)
- Lead G: phone="777-777-7777" (NEW - no match)
... (212 more new leads)

Total: 217 leads (all from your upload)
```

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Will I lose my existing production data?
**A: NO.** The script only ADDS new leads or UPDATES matching ones.

### Q: What if I already have leads in production?
**A:** Leads with matching phone numbers will be updated. New phone numbers will create new leads.

### Q: Can I run the import multiple times?
**A: YES.** Running it multiple times won't create duplicates (phone matching prevents this).

### Q: What if import fails halfway?
**A:** Successful imports are saved. You can re-run and it will continue from where it stopped.

### Q: Will this slow down my production site?
**A: NO.** The import runs in the background via Render shell. Your site continues running normally.

## Summary
