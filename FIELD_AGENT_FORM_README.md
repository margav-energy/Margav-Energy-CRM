## Data Flow

```
Field Agent â†’ Offline Form â†’ IndexedDB â†’ Service Worker â†’ API â†’ Database â†’ Lead Creation â†’ Qualifier Review
```

## Offline Behavior

### When Offline:
- Form data is saved to IndexedDB
- Photos and signatures stored as base64
- User sees "Offline" indicator
- Pending submissions counter shows

### When Back Online:
- Service worker automatically syncs pending data
- Background sync processes all offline submissions
- Success notifications shown to user
- Pending counter resets

## API Endpoints

### Auto Lead Creation
When a field submission is created, it automatically:
1. Creates a new Lead with status 'sent_to_kelly'
2. Formats assessment data into lead notes
3. Links the submission to the lead
4. Makes it available for qualifier review
