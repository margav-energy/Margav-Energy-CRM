# API Error Fix - Complete Solution

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Identified:**
The 400 (Bad Request) and 500 (Internal Server Error) API errors were caused by:

1. **Missing `assigned_agent` field**: Frontend was not sending the required `assigned_agent` field
2. **Serializer field mismatch**: Backend serializer expected `assigned_agent` but frontend wasn't providing it
3. **Soft delete fields**: Backend had soft delete fields that weren't properly handled in serializers

## âœ… **Complete Fix Applied:**

### **1. Backend Serializer Fix** (`backend/leads/serializers.py`)
**Before:**
```python
class LeadCreateSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Lead
        fields = ['full_name', 'phone', 'email', 'status', 'notes', 'appointment_date']
```

**After:**
```python
class LeadCreateSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Lead
        fields = ['full_name', 'phone', 'email', 'status', 'notes', 'appointment_date', 'assigned_agent']
        read_only_fields = ['is_deleted', 'deleted_at', 'deleted_by', 'deletion_reason']
```

### **2. Frontend API Call Fix** (`frontend/src/components/AgentDashboard.tsx`)
**Before:**
```typescript
const leadDataWithStatus: LeadFormType & { status: Lead['status'] } = {
  ...leadData,
  status: hasPendingCallback ? 'callback' as Lead['status'] : 'sent_to_kelly' as Lead['status']
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const leadDataWithStatus: LeadFormType & { status: Lead['status']; assigned_agent: number } = {
  ...leadData,
  status: hasPendingCallback ? 'callback' as Lead['status'] : 'sent_to_kelly' as Lead['status'],
  assigned_agent: user?.id || 0
};
```

### **3. All Lead Creation Points Fixed**
- âœ… `handleCreateLead` - New lead creation
- âœ… `handleSendToQualifier` - Lead updates and creation
- âœ… Dialer lead updates
- âœ… All lead creation scenarios

## ðŸ”§ **Why This Fix Works:**

1. **Required Field**: `assigned_agent` is now included in all API calls
2. **User Context**: Frontend automatically assigns the current user as the agent
3. **Serializer Compatibility**: Backend serializer now properly handles all required fields
4. **Soft Delete Handling**: Soft delete fields are marked as read-only to prevent conflicts

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Results:**

- âœ… **No More 400 Errors**: All required fields are now provided
- âœ… **No More 500 Errors**: Soft delete fields are properly handled
- âœ… **Lead Creation Works**: New leads can be created successfully
- âœ… **Lead Updates Work**: Existing leads can be updated
- âœ… **Callback Creation**: Automatic callback creation via Django signals

## ðŸ§ª **Testing:**

1. **Create New Lead**: Should work without errors
2. **Update Existing Lead**: Should work without errors
3. **Send to Qualifier**: Should work without errors
4. **Callback Creation**: Should automatically create callbacks for callback status leads

The API errors should now be completely resolved!
