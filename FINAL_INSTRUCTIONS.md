### Step 2: Upload JSON File

Upload `production_leads_export.json` to the Render shell:
- Look for "Upload File" button in the shell interface
- Or drag and drop the file

### Step 3: Run Import

In the Render shell, run:

```bash
python paste_into_render_shell.py
```

OR paste the entire content of `paste_into_render_shell.py` into the shell and run it.

## ‚úÖ Data Safety - IMPORTANT!

**Your existing production data is SAFE:**

1. ‚úÖ **ADD operation** - Only adds new leads
2. ‚úÖ **UPDATE operation** - Updates matching leads (by phone number)
3. ‚ùå **NO DELETE** - Never deletes existing data
4. ‚ùå **NO OVERWRITE** - Doesn't replace your production database

The script checks by phone number:
- If lead with that phone exists ‚Üí **Update it**
- If phone doesn't exist ‚Üí **Create new lead**
- Your existing production leads remain untouched

---

## üîç Quick Check

After running the import, verify:

1. Go to your production site: https://crm.margav.energy
2. Login as admin
3. Dashboard should show 217 leads (or more if you had existing ones)
